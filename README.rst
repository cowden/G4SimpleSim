Geant4 Simple Simulation
========================
Simple simulation scenarios.


* base - a basic sampling calorimeter based on the B4 example included
in the Geant4 distribution.
* fiber - simulate the cherenkov light signal received at the end of a
quartz fiber when a charged particle traveres it.
